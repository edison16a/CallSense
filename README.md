## CallSense

We created CallSense, which is designed to help 911 operators manage high call volumes by transcribing and summarizing dispatcher calls in real time using the Google Gemini API. It highlights key information, guides dispatchers with targeted questions, and uses a classification model to prioritize incidents, helping reduce operator burden, improve reporting accuracy, and support faster, better decisions.
